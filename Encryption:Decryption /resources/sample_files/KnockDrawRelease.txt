[Pre-Chorus]
Why in the hell are you so nervous, baby?
You look perfect, baby
And you'll marry quite a jealous man, you heard it, baby, that just confirmed it for me
Don't believe what anybody says to you about me
Sources get a bit contorted when they're tertiary
I'll tell you everything I know if you just asked it of me, I spoke quite casually
Could've said I loved you then because I did, knock, draw, and release

[Chorus]
But only when you're certain, I don't wanna hurt no one
I'll get it right this time
I'm slowly learning if something isn't hurting, that means it isn't working
It probably isn't urgent, my God
You're such an angel, but I don't deserve it
I built those walls years ago to be impervious
If any crack will show, it means the time has come
You've gotta let me go before I fail you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Why in the hell are you so nervous, baby?
You look perfect, baby
And you'll marry quite a jealous man, you heard it, baby, that just confirmed it for me
Don't believe what anybody says to you about me
Sources get a bit contorted when they're tertiary
I'll tell you everything I know if you just asked it of me, I spoke quite casually
Could've said I loved you then because I did, knock, draw, and release

[Chorus 2]
But only when you're certain, I don't wanna hurt no one
I'll get it right this time
I'm slowly learning if something isn't hurting, that means it isn't working
It probably isn't urgent, my God
You're such an angel, but I don't deserve it
I built those walls years ago to be impervious
If any crack will show, it means the time has come
You've gotta let me go before I fail you, yeah
